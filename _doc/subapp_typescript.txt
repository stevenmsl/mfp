- webpack needs to resolve ts and tsx files
  while bundling
  - code sample: #SUBAPPTS01

- babel needs to know it needs compile TS
  - code sample: #SUBAPPTS02

- both TS and TSX can be exposed
  - code sample: #SUBAPPTS03

- tsconfig.json is not really needed by webpack, 
  but we need one to address an type-checking 
  error in the code
  - code sample: #SUBAPPTS04
